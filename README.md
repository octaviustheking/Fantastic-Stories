      <h3>1st Story: The Legend of the Giant Heads!</h3>
      <p>By octaviusaszeto@gmail.com</p>
      <p>100 million years ago...<br>Giant heads roamed the Earth! One day, a spaceship came down and zipped all of the giants heads' mouths. The giant heads froze in place but could still blink and were still alive. The giant heads <e>somehow</e> survived the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs. (And 70% of the planets life)</p>
        <p> </p>
  <p>100 million years later... <br> After the land was changed (and a lot of other things that happened), a giant head <e>somehow</e> appeared <strong><e>in the middle of the USA!</e></strong>The other giant heads were lost to history. Except for one. <e>But...</e> that one appeared on the slope of a active volcano. So, back to the giant head that survived. People now climb this giant head to pick the diamonds in its nose. (<e>ewww...</e>) But if you are unlucky, the giant head will sneeze and you will be met by a barrage of booger-covered diamonds!</p>
